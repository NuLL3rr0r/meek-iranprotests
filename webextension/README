Installation guide for the meek-http-helper WebExtension.

The WebExtension is made of two parts: the extension and the native
application. The extension itself is JavaScript, runs in the browser,
and is responsible for making HTTP requests as instructed. The native
application runs as a subprocess of the browser; its job is to open a
localhost socket and act as an intermediary between the extension and
meek-client, because the extension cannot open a socket by itself.

These instructions require Firefox 65.

1. Compile the native application.
       cd native && go build

2. Edit meek.http.helper.json and set the "path" field to the path to
   the native application.
       "path": "/where/you/installed/native",

3. Copy the edited meek.http.helper.json file to the OS-appropriate
   location.
       # macOS
       mkdir -p ~/"Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts/"
       cp meek.http.helper.json ~/"Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts/"
       # other Unix
       mkdir -p ~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/
       cp meek.http.helper.json ~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/
   The meek.http.helper.json file is called the "host manifest" or "app
   manifest" and it tells the browser where to find the native part of
   the WebExtension. More information:

4. Run Firefox in a terminal so you can see its stdout. In Firefox, go
   to about:config and set
       browser.dom.window.dump.enabled=true
   This enables the extension to write to stdout.

5. In Firefox, go to about:debugging and click "Load Temporary
   Add-on...". Find manifest.json and click Open.
   More information:
       https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/about:debugging#Loading_a_temporary_add-on
   In the terminal, you should see a line like this, with a random port
   number in place of XXXX:
       meek-http-helper: listen 127.0.0.1:XXXX

Now the extension is running and ready to start making requests. You can
run "meek-client --helper", passing it the correct port number XXXX:
	UseBridges 1
	ClientTransportPlugin meek exec ./meek-client --helper 127.0.0.1:XXXX --log meek-client.log
	Bridge meek 0.0.2.0:1 url=https://meek.bamsoftware.com/

To debug, open the browser console with Ctrl+Shift+J.
