# How to run a meek-server (meek bridge):

You need a server with a DNS name pointing to it.
You need to be able to run a service on port 443.

Let's say the server's DNS name is meek.example.com.

- Compile the program using 'go build'.

	cd meek-server
	go build

- Install meek-server under /usr/local/bin and give it permission to bind to port 443.

	cp meek-server /usr/local/bin
	setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/local/bin/meek-server

- Add a line to your torrc file. Replace "meek.example.com" with your server's DNS name and "admin@meek.example.com" with your email address.

	ServerTransportPlugin meek exec /usr/local/bin/meek-server --acme-hostnames meek.example.com --acme-email admin@meek.example.com --log /var/log/tor/meek-server.log

- To test your bridge on the client side, you can add a line like this to your torrc:

	Bridge meek 0.0.2.0:1 url=https://meek.example.com/

# Important Note:

	If you're running more than one transport, you need a separate tor process for each, to avoid user counting confusion.
